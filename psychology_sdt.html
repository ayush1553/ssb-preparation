        <h2>📝 Introduction</h2>
        <p>In this section, candidates are given <b>15 minutes⏱️</b> and asked to write five different paragraphs describing:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What their parents think of them 👨‍👩‍👧</li>
            <li>What their teachers/employers think of them 👨‍🏫👩‍💼</li>
            <li>What their friends/colleagues think 🤝</li>
            <li>What they think of themselves 💭</li>
            <li>What kind of person they want to become or what improvements they want 🌱✨</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="tip">
            <b>⚠️ Remember:</b> You must project your true qualities while staying realistic. Avoid exaggerations 🚫. If you claim to be a top student 📚 but have low marks, it won’t be believable ❌.
